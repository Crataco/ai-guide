# Introduction

_I assume you've come here either via word-of-mouth or through your own research. This guide will touch upon the world of LLMs (Large Language Models) that you can run on your own computer instead of it being tied to an online service._

_[My original guide](https://old.reddit.com/user/Crataco/comments/zuowi9/opensource_chatbot_companions/) was created with chatbot users in mind, but quickly expanded to the point of being hard to manage. For this guide, I hope to include all types of users, but most of my knowledge are when it comes to chatbots. I also intend on linking to other guides by the community._

_This specific guide will touch upon:_

- Frontends (user interfaces)

- Models (the AI brains)

- Creating a Character (for chatbot users)

- Settings (which affect the AI's generations)
