# Frontends

### What are frontends?

A frontend is the interface you use to run and interact with your AI. To avoid confusion, this guide separates them into two categories: standalone and proxy.

**Standalone** frontends work on their own, and are used to run and interact with the models.

Here are two recommended standalone frontends for beginners:
- **[Faraday](https://faraday.dev/)** *(for friendly chat and roleplay) (closed-source, but offline)*
- **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)** *(for assistant chat)*

And here are two recommended standalone frontends for power users:
- **[KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)** *(for story co-writing, friendly chat and roleplay, assistant chat, and text adventure)*
- **[Oobabooga's Text Generation Web UI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)** *(for story co-writing, friendly chat and roleplay, and assistant chat)*

**Proxy** frontends are often chat/roleplay-oriented. They can't run the AI on their own, so they need a standalone frontend running in the background to connect to. So far, the two most widely-supported frontends they can connect to are Oobabooga's and Kobold's.

The most popular and actively developed of these proxy frontends is **[SillyTavern](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern)**, but there's also the original [Tavern](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI) it branched off from, and more obscure proxy frontends such as [miku.gg](https://docs.miku.gg/), [Laika's LiteVN UI](https://laika-ch.itch.io/laikas-litevn-ui-for-koboldai), and [RisuAI](https://github.com/kwaroran/RisuAI).
