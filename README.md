*Version 1 of my AI guide is [still available here](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/original.md). While that one was more of a crash course, this one is meant to be more of a softer introduction, split up into small parts.*

_Hello! I assume you've come here either via word-of-mouth or through your own research. I hope for this guide to enlighten you on text generation AI that you can run without being tied to an online service. I want to make this version of my guide unbelievably simple compared to version 1, and as such it'll focls only on these two important things:_

- _[Frontends (the interfaces)](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/frontends.md)_

- _[Models (the AI brains)](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/models.md)_
