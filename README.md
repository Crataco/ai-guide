*As of July 29th, 2023, this guide is now under sporadic maintenance.*

*This handbook still stands as strong as ever if you're looking for a helping hand understanding AI jargon.*

*If you're here just for up-to-date information on frontends and models, see [this guide](https://github.com/underlines/awesome-marketing-datascience/blob/master/README.md) and [this community](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/).*

# Open-Source Text Generation AI Guide

This is a guide for Large Language Models (LLMs) that you can run on your own computer. These can be viable alternatives to Replika and CharacterAI, ChatGPT, GPT-3, and various others.

You have two options from here:

- [The Current Guide](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/frontends.md) focuses on quality and cleanliness, and does a better job at introducing you to things in layman's terms.
 
- [The Spaghetti Guide](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/original.md) is more of a crash course that shoves in more information all in one page, and includes the LLMs that existed before LLaMA.
