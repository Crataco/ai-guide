*As of July 29th, 2023, this guide has been updated sporadically.*

*While the author can't promise this will always be up-to-date, this handbook still stands as strong as ever if you're looking for a helping hand understanding AI jargon.*

*If you're here just for up-to-date information on frontends and models, see [this guide](https://github.com/underlines/awesome-marketing-datascience/blob/master/README.md) and [this community](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/).*

# Open-Source Text Generation AI Guide

This is a guide for Large Language Models (LLMs) that you can run on your own computer. These can be viable alternatives to Replika, CharacterAI, ChatGPT, GPT-3, NovelAI, and various others.

You have two options from here:

- [The Current Guide](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/table-of-contents.md) focuses on teaching all of the basics in a thorough, multi-page manner. The author highly recommends you read this one if you're new.
 
- [The Spaghetti Guide](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/original.md) is where it all started: a crash course that shoves all of the information in one page. This is relatively out-of-date compared to the current guide, but gives a glimpse into the optimism of AI pre-LLaMA.
