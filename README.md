# Crataco's Quick & Dirty Open-Source AI Guide

*Hi! I figured adding my chatbot guide to GitHub would be better for version control, visibility, forking, and organization. I'll work on this in private until I'm ready to make it public.*

*This intends to be simplified and cover less bases than my [original Reddit guide](https://old.reddit.com/user/Crataco/comments/zuowi9/opensource_chatbot_companions/).*
*If you want to read my new guide, [start at the introduction](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/introduction.md).*
