# Open-Source Text Generation AI Guide

This is the landing page for a guide dedicated to Large Language Models (LLMs) that you can run on your computer, and assumes that your PC is a lower-end, non-gaming setup. The models you can run can then be used as alternatives to ChatGPT, CharacterAI, Replika, and many others.

*Alternatively, if you're looking for u/Crataco's original Reddit guide, it can be found [here](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/original.md). It takes a crash course approach, but is very out-of-date.*
