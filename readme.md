# Introduction

_Hello! I assume you've come here either via word-of-mouth or through your own research. This guide will touch upon the world of text generation AI that you can run on your own computer without being tied to an online service. I intend to make this unbelievably simple compared to my Reddit post, to keep things easy to follow._

_[My original guide](https://old.reddit.com/user/Crataco/comments/zuowi9/opensource_chatbot_companions/) was created with chatbot users in mind, but quickly expanded to the point of being hard to manage and read. For this guide, I hope to include all types of users. I also intend on linking to other guides by the community._

_For now, this specific guide will touch upon:_

- *[Frontends (the interfaces)](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/frontends.md)*

- *[Models (the AI brains)](https://github.com/Crataco/ai-guide/blob/main/guide/models.md)*
